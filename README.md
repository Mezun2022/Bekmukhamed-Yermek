This is a simple weather application that allows users to retrieve current weather data for a given location. The application has both a backend component that fetches weather data from an external API and a frontend GUI component that displays the weather information to the user.


The code consists of three main classes: AppLauncher, WeatherApp, and WeatherAppGui.
AppLauncher is the entry point of the application and launches the GUI by creating an instance of WeatherAppGui.
WeatherApp contains the backend logic for fetching weather data from an external API. It retrieves geographic coordinates for a given location, makes an API request, and parses the JSON response.
WeatherAppGui is responsible for creating and displaying the graphical user interface. It includes components such as text fields, labels, and buttons to interact with the user.
